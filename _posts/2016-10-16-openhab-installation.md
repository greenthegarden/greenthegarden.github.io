description: Installing and configuring openHAB
categories: beginner
---

I run [openHAB](http://www.openhab.org/) on a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) as the basis of my home automation using the following configuration.

# Other Packages

In order to best utilise openHAB the following additional packages are utilised.

## Samba

Install Samba to enable editing of configurations via an external computer.

### Installation

```
sudo apt-get install samba samba-common-bin
```

### Configuration

Edit the file `/etc/samba/smb.conf` to make the following changes

#### Enable wins support

Change `# wins support = no` to `wins support = yes`.

#### Enable symbolic link support

Add the following lines

```
follow symlinks = yes
wide links = yes
```

#### Share openhab folders

Add the following lines to share pi home folder

```
[pi Home]
comment= pi Home
path=/home/pi
valid users = @pi
browseable=Yes
writeable=Yes
only guest=no
create mask=0777
directory mask=0777
public=no
```

Add the following lines to share openhab folders

```
[OpenHAB Home]
comment= openHAB Home
path=/usr/share/openhab
valid users = @pi @openhab
browseable=Yes
writeable=Yes
only guest=no
create mask=0777
directory mask=0777
public=no

[OpenHAB Config]
comment= openHAB Site Config
valid users = @pi @openhab
path=/etc/openhab
browseable=Yes
writeable=Yes
only guest=no
create mask=0777
directory mask=0777
public=no
```

Set passwords for pi and openhab user

```
sudo smbpasswd -a pi
sudo smbpasswd -a openhab
```

Restart samba

```
sudo /bin/systemctl restart smbd.service
```

#### Test shared drive

On Mac use `Finder -> Go -> Connect to Server` and the address `smb://openhab@raspberrypi.local`.


## Mosquitto

See



## mySQL

### Installation

```
sudo apt-get install mysql-server python-mysqldb
```

Will be required to set a root password during the installation.


## Radicale

The [Radicale Project](http://radicale.org/) is a complete CalDAV (calendar) and CardDAV (contact) server solution.

```
sudo apt-get install radicale
```

##  Network UPS tools

Based on instructions at http://abakalidis.blogspot.com.au/2013/04/using-raspberry-pi-as-ups-server-with.html

```
sudo apt-get install nut-client nut-server
```

Add nut group to pi user

```
sudo usermod -a -G nut pi
```

Note: for a Synology NAS to access the nut server specific values need to be set!! See https://tellini.info/2014/09/connecting-a-synology-diskstation-to-a-nut-server/

Set up the driver for the nut server by adding the following lines to the file `/etc/nut/ups.conf`

```
[ups]
  driver = usbhid-ups
  port = auto
  desc = "APC ES550"
```

Test the UPS driver

```
upsdrvctl start
```

Configure upsd by adding the following to the file `/etc/nut/upsd.conf`, where 192.168.1.55 is the IP address of the PI.

```
LISTEN 127.0.0.1 3493
LISTEN 192.168.1.55 3493
```

Configure users by adding the following to the file `/etc/nut/upsd.users`:

```
[upsmon_local]
    password = pi
    upsmon master
[upsmon_remote]
    password = pi
    upsmon slave
# The following user is required for a Synology NAS
[monuser]
    password = secret
    upsmon slave
```

Specify the UPS for the UPS monitor daeon to monitor by adding the following lines to the file `/etc/nut/upsmon.conf`:

```
MONITOR ups@localhost 1 upsmon_local pi master
```

Open the file `/etc/nut/nut.conf` and change the value of Mode to netserver -- making sure that there are no spaces between each side of the = sign

Change from:

```
Mode=none
```

to

```
Mode=netserver
```

To start server and client use

```
service nut-server start
service nut-client start
```

To test use

```
upsc ups
```

Example result:

```

## Sigar Installation

To use the SystemInfo Binding on a PI

Instructions based on information at  https://github.com/openhab/openhab/wiki/Systeminfo-Binding

```
wget https://groups.google.com/group/openhab/attach/ab7030271be23f05/sigar-raspbian.zip?part=0.1 -O ~/sigar-raspbian.zip
```

Unzip archive:

```
unzip ~/sigar-raspbian.zip -d ~
```

Create a lib folder first for apt-get installations:

```
sudo mkdir /usr/share/openhab/lib
```

Then copy the downloaded files to the new lib folder:

```
sudo cp ~/sigar-raspbian/lib/* /usr/share/openhab/lib
```

echo "deb http://dl.bintray.com/openhab/apt-repo stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/openhab.list
sudo apt-get update
```

Install openHAB runtime

```
sudo apt-get install openhab-runtime
```

Statement at end of installation to automatically start

```
### NOT starting on installation, please execute the following statements to configure openHAB to start automatically using systemd
 sudo /bin/systemctl daemon-reload
 sudo /bin/systemctl enable openhab.service
### You can start openhab by executing
 sudo /bin/systemctl start openhab.service
```

To restart use

```
sudo /bin/systemctl restart openhab.service
```

Set group and owner to openhab (from root)

```
sudo chown -hR openhab:openhab /etc/openhab
sudo chown -hR openhab:openhab /usr/share/openhab
```


## Installation of bindings

Installation of bindings uses the following form

```
sudo apt-get install openhab-addon-${addon-type}-${addon-name}
```

To find the name of binding use

```
sudo apt-cache search openhab
```

Use the following to install bindings for
http, ntp, weather, persistence-logging, persistence-rrd4j, persistence-mysql, mqtt, systeminfo, astro, networkupstools, caldav, dropbox

```
sudo apt-get install openhab-addon-binding-astro
sudo apt-get install openhab-addon-binding-caldav-command
sudo apt-get install openhab-addon-binding-caldav-personal
sudo apt-get install openhab-addon-binding-http
sudo apt-get install openhab-addon-binding-mqtt
sudo apt-get install openhab-addon-binding-networkhealth
sudo apt-get install openhab-addon-binding-networkupstools
sudo apt-get install openhab-addon-binding-ntp
sudo apt-get install openhab-addon-binding-systeminfo
sudo apt-get install openhab-addon-binding-weather
sudo apt-get install openhab-addon-io-caldav
sudo apt-get install openhab-addon-io-dropbox
sudo apt-get install openhab-addon-persistence-caldav
sudo apt-get install openhab-addon-persistence-logging
sudo apt-get install openhab-addon-persistence-mysql
sudo apt-get install openhab-addon-persistence-rrd4j
```


## Configure MySQL

Connect to mySQL server using

```
mysql -u root -p
```

Create a new database for openHAB

```
CREATE DATABASE openhab;
```

Create an 'openhab' user with password 'openhab'

```
CREATE USER 'openhab'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'openhab';
```

Set permissions for 'openhab' user to access 'openhab' database

```
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON openhab . * TO 'openhab'@'localhost';
```

Configure openhab to use mysql persistence.

## Configure Radicale

A good guide to configure radicale is http://jonathantutorial.blogspot.com.au/2014/10/how-to-set-up-radicale.html

Open the configuration file `/etc/radicale/config` and change the following:


```
#daemon = False
```

to

```
daemon = True
```

To have radicale automatically start open the file `/etc/default/radicale` and uncomment the line:


```
#ENABLE_RADICALE=yes
```

To start radicale use

```
sudo systemctl start radicale.service
```

Install apache2-utils to manage users and passwords using

```
sudo apt-get install apache2-utils
```

Need to create two calenders
  - openhab, as http://192.168.1.55:5232/openhab/openhab.ics/
  - history, as http://192.168.1.55:5232/openhab/history.ics/

### Image Refresh

Refreshing an image periodically (every second)

Define the following in the sitemap:

```
Remote image:
Image url="http://192.168.1.55/jpg/image.jpg" refresh=1000

Locale image:
Image url="/jpg/image.jpg" refresh=1000
```
The image "jpg/image.jpg" needs to be located in `$OPENHAB_ROOT/webapps/` folder.
