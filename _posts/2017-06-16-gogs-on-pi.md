# Gogs on pi

[Gogs](https://gogs.io/) provides a self-hosted [git](https://git-scm.com/) service which includes a web-based interface and is capabile of running on a [Raspberry Pi](https://raspberrypi.org).

## Download

Download the latest version of Gogs from <https://gogs.io/docs/installation/install_from_binary>.

One of the best things about Gogs is that it will run without any dependencies, apart from Git!

## Install

```
cd /home/pi
wget gogs.zip
unzip gogs.zip
sudo cp  gogs/scripts/systemd/gogs.service /etc/systemd/system/
```

## Configuration

Make the following modification to `/etc/systemd/system/gogs.service`.

Comment line `After=mariadb.service mysqld.service postgresql.service memcached.service redis.service`.

Change user and group to `pi`, and ensure paths are all `/home/pi`.

To have Gogs run at startup use

```
sudo systemctl enable gogs
sudo systemctl start gogs
```

## Running

By default the web-based interface to Gogs runs on port 3000, so open an browser and head to address, `http://<ip>:3000>`.
